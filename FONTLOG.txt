FONTLOG for Printline

This file provides detailed information on the Printline Font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Printline fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Printline is a work-in-progress condensed typeface with a bold personality. Inspired by interchangeable letter boards and the charm of mid-century hand-painted signs, Printline stands out with its large x-height and expressive character. Printline is currently in beta. The typeface works best in larger text like headers and subheadings, making it well-suited for branding and packaging. Printline is an ongoing project, with future plans to expand its language support and refine its spacing and kerning for optimal usability.
