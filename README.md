# Eddie Sans
------

Eddie Sans is a  work in progress condensed typeface with a bold personality. Inspired by interchangeable letter boards and the charm of mid-century hand-painted signs, Eddie stands out with its large x-height and expressive character. 
#### Character set
Eddie currently has a crude Latin set, from A-Z,a-z.0-9 and some symbols.
#### Roadmap
Keep in mind this is a rough roadmap
- Expansion of the Latin character set
- Addition of weight
- Possible addition of support for the Devanagari script
