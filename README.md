Printline (previously Eddie Sans) is a work in progress condensed typeface with a bold personality. Inspired by interchangeable letter boards and the charm of mid-century hand-painted signs, Printline stands out with its large x-height and expressive character. 
# Character set
Printline currently has the Core Latin glyphset, basic soft dotting has been implemented but it might cause problems in with larger combinations.
# Roadmap
Keep in mind this is a rough roadmap
- ~~Expansion of the Latin character set~~
- Addition of weight
- Possible addition of support for the Devanagari script
